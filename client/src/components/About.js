          According to the 2018 Waste and Recycling figures from the EPA, the average person in the United States generates around 4.9 pounds of waste per day. If everyone in the United States recycled just one more item per day (around 0.5 pounds), this could result in an additional (331,449,281 x 0.5 x 365) = 60,489,493,782 pounds of waste being diverted from landfills each year.
